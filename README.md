# Superstore Sales Analysis

### Project Background:
Online shopping has become popular because it is convenient and allows people to bargain shop from their home or office. During holidays, it eliminates the need to wait in long lines or search for items. This project will use data analysis to help a US-based superstore identify top-performing and least profitable product categories and sales segments to optimize their operations and increase profits.

### Tools:
Python, Google Colab
